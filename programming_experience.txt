Hello, my name is Melanie T. Huynh and I am a 4th year Bioengineering student at OSU. I know three languages: Python, Julia, and MatLab. Python, I learned from the CS online courses starting last year (1 year). For Julia, I have been in research using Julia since my 1st year (3 years) and MatLab was taught to us our 1st year as well (3 years). MatLab has its own, custom IDE where the program is very independent of any other IDE. I’m not sure if it is possible to use MatLab anywhere except its own program! For both Julia and Python, I have used vim, Atom, and Jupyter notebook. Python allows me to also use PyCharm. In my first year, we were required to learn a MatLab specific course called CBEE102 which laid the foundation of programming and simple algorithms to perform operations. I am self-taught in Julia. Lastly, my programming-related classes for Python are only from CS161 and CS162.
